                 Boeing Digital Technical Documents Overview
 =======================================================================

 The Boeing Digital Technical Documents Version 2 contains an application
 CD and data CD's.  The data is designed to be installed and run from the 
 Technical Documents application.  The data can also be installed and
 run from the Portable Maintenance Aid (PMA). However, if the application
 is not available to the user, the data CD's can be run without the
 application.  There is a chapter list, and on some CD's, a document list,
 that provides access to the contents of the manual on the data CD's. 

 The data CD's are designed to start automatically when inserted in a 
 CD-ROM drive if the Technical Documents application or the PMA
 application is not installed, and Adobe (Registered Trademark) Acrobat
 Reader is installed.  When you insert a data CD in the CD-ROM drive, 
 the Reader will start and the chapter list or document list will show.
 Bookmarks are on the left side of the screen that give you a way to
 navigate to the document on the data CD.  If the document list shows,
 select the bookmark for the document you want to view.  When the chapter
 list shows, select the bookmark for the chapter you want to go to.

 You use the following procedures to configure your PC for using the 
 correct version of Adobe Acrobat Reader and for Autorun of the CD.  You
 must use Adobe Acrobat Reader 4.0 with Search or higher to use the search
 function provided with your technical documents.  If Adobe Acrobat Reader
 is installed but is not Adobe Acrobat Reader 4.0 with Search or higher,
 or if Adobe Acrobat Reader is not installed on your PC, a prompt will
 show that will ask you if you want to install the correct version of
 Reader.

 You must have Adobe Reader to view the PDF documents.  If you do not have
 Adobe Reader please contact your system Administrator.

                  Contents of the Data CD
 =======================================================================

  - Loader application
  - Documentlist file (for multiple part documents)
  - Chapterlist file(s)
  - Document PDF files
  - Configuration files

 The document list file contains links to the different parts of the
 document.

 The chapter list file(s) contain links to the chapters of the applicable
 document, the Temporary Revision (TR) folder, and Help.

 The document PDF files are the PDF files for the applicable document.

 The configuration files contain information necessary for the

 installed document.

 The accessories folder contains help and install files.  These files 
 give information on using the data CD's if you do not use the Boeing
 Digital Technical Documents application.

 The network folder contains PDF chapter list file(s) that you can use
 to setup access to the document files on a network.  See the install

                  Installing Boeing Digital Technical Documents
 =======================================================================
 Use this section for general steps to install the Boeing Digital
 Technical Documents product for use without the Technical Documents
 or PMA applications.

  1. Install Adobe Acrobat Reader (the loader program will prompt you to
     install the correct version if it is not already installed).
  2. Setup temporary revisions (see install.pdf or install.hlp).
 
 You can find detailed installation instructions in the Install.hlp and 
 Install.pdf files.

 =======================================================================
                      Using Help and Installation Files
 =======================================================================

 The help files on the data CD's provide information for using the 
 functionality provided in the Boeing Digital Technical Documents product,
 including Adobe Acrobat Reader, when used without the application.
 The installation files on the data CD's provide information for setup and
 installation of your TR's on a local PC or on a network server. 
 Two help files and two Installation files have been provided on your data 
 CD's.  

 The help files are help.hlp and help.pdf.  The content of each file is
 the same but provided in two formats for you to choose your preferred
 format. It is recommended that if you want to print the help contents
 you open the help.pdf file and print that file.

 The installation files are install.hlp and install.pdf.  The content of
 each file is the same but provided in two formats for you to choose your
 preferred format. It is recommended that if you want to print the 
 installation file contents you open the install.pdf and print that file.

 =======================================================================
                      CD Will Not Start Automatically	
 =======================================================================

 Boeing Digital Technical Documents data CD's are designed to start
 automatically when inserted into a CD-ROM drive if Technical
 Documents or PMA application's are not installed, and Adobe Acrobat 
 Reader is installed.  If a Technical Documents data CD does not start
 automatically, do the steps that follow to get to the document.
	1. Click Start on your Windows task bar
	2. Choose Run from the Start menu
	3. Open the CD-ROM Drive and Browse to DOCUMENTLIST.pdf or 
           CHAPTERLIST_ACRONYM.pdf (where ACRONYM is the document
           acronym), or type:
	   (CD-ROM drive letter):\DOCUMENTLIST.pdf 
           (example: E:\DOCUMENTLIST.pdf)
           or
           (CD-ROM drive letter):\CHAPTERLIST_ACRONYM.pdf
           (example: E:\CHAPTERLIST_SRM.pdf)
	4. Select OK
	
 Note: You must follow this process each time you want to start a data 
       CD. Contact your local IS support to configure the PC for
       autoplay.
 
 =======================================================================
                                 Using Indexes
 =======================================================================

 Each data CD (except for the Fuel Measuring Stick Manual) contains an
 index file for the document on the CD.  Indexes will attach
 automatically when you open a chapter in the document.  It is possible
 that you can have more than one index attached at one time (for example
 you could have indexes for the 737 AMM and the DC-9/MD-80 SRM attached
 at one time). If multiple indexes are attached when you do a search you
 will get results for all documents with attached indexes. You must be
 careful to select the correct model/manual when you get results from a
 search.  See the Help documentation for Technical Documents for more
 information.

 NOTE: When you search for a word or phrase that contains a hyphen (-)
       or a slash (/), use an asterisk (*) instead of the hyphen or 
       slash. For example, if you want to find part number 251A2147-1,
       type 251A2147*1 in the search box.
